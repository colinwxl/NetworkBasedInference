# Network Based Inference

This project containbs code implementing the Network Based Inference technique for use as a recommendation engine. 

## Getting Started

The code implemented works as a sci-kit learn classifier. It will fit the NBI weighted adjacency matrix on a bipartite graph of
person-by-object. It will then predict likely objects for a new person, given any past object acquisition behaviour. Please see the reference 
below for the details of algorithm.

### Prerequisites

```
sklearn
numpy
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
